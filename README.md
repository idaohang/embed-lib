embed-lib
=========

This is a C++ library of classes for embedded electronic devices such as sensors, GPS modules, wireless modules, etc.  It currently only supports the BeagleBone Black, but is designed such that cross platform support can easily be added by sub-classing a few generic interface classes.  I am essentially building it on-demand for my current projects, so it will expand over time and gain more cross-platform support over time.
